### What is Markdown?
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating list are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:
* [Gists](https://gist.github.com/discover)
* Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
* Files with the `.md` or `.markdown` extensions

For mor information, see "[Writing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/)" in the *GitHub Help*.
